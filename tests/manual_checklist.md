# Manual Checklist
- Start app: no window, tray icon appears
- Press Alt+Shift+A: capture mode armed (no on-screen UI)
- Drag LMB to select region, release: clipboard contains image
- Paste into Paint/Word/WeChat via Ctrl+V: image appears
- ESC during armed mode: cancels; clipboard unchanged
- Repeated captures 10 times: no crash, no stuck hook
- Multi-monitor (if available): capture works on secondary monitor and negative coords
